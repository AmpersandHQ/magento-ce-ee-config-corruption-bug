# Magento Bug - Corrupted Config Cache 

http://ampersandcommerce.com 
##Preface##
The majority of my experimentation took place on EE 1.13.0.1 and while this bug does also affect CE 1.9.1.0 I will be referring to EE 1.13.0.1 code throughout the explanation.

##`Mage_Core_Model_Config` and Caching##

`Mage_Core_Model_Config` is the class responsible for merging all the system configuration files (config.xml, local.xml) and module configuration files (config.xml) into one object. There are 3 basic parts to the `Mage_Core_Model_Config::init()` call

1. Loading the base config (config.xml and local.xml files).
2. Attempting to load the rest of the config from cache.
3. (On cache load failure) Load the remainder of the config from xml and the database, then save it into cache.

```php
    /**
     * Initialization of core configuration
     *
     * @return Mage_Core_Model_Config
     */
    public function init($options=array())
    {
        $this->setCacheChecksum(null);
        $this->_cacheLoadedSections = array();
        $this->setOptions($options);
        $this->loadBase();

        $cacheLoad = $this->loadModulesCache();
        if ($cacheLoad) {
            return $this;
        }
        $this->loadModules();
        $this->loadDb();
        $this->saveCache();
        return $this;
    }
```

If at any point something were to silently go wrong within `loadModules` or `loadDb`, then corrupted configuration would be saved into cache, meaning that the following request would be served invalid configuration.

`Mage_Core_Model_Config` also has a protected variable `$_useCache`, when this flag is set Magento will attempt to use load sections of the config from cache storage then persist them within the singleton itself. 

This logic is underpinned by the `_getSectionConfig` function.

```php
    /**
     * Getter for section configuration object
     *
     * @param array $path
     * @return Mage_Core_Model_Config_Element
     */
    protected function _getSectionConfig($path)
    {
        $section = $path[0];
        if (!isset($this->_cacheSections[$section])) {
            return false;
        }
        $sectionPath = array_slice($path, 0, $this->_cacheSections[$section]+1);
        $sectionKey = implode('_', $sectionPath);

        if (!isset($this->_cacheLoadedSections[$sectionKey])) {
            Varien_Profiler::start('init_config_section:' . $sectionKey);
            $this->_cacheLoadedSections[$sectionKey] = $this->_loadSectionCache($sectionKey);
            Varien_Profiler::stop('init_config_section:' . $sectionKey);
        }

        if ($this->_cacheLoadedSections[$sectionKey] === false) {
            return false;
        }
        return $this->_cacheLoadedSections[$sectionKey];
    }
```

##Symptoms##

The following symptoms would usually manifest when the website is experiencing high load, and very often after a cache flush was triggered. The symptoms persist until you flush the `CONFIG` cache.

###Enterprise Edition###
Your website produces nothing but `Front controller reached 100 router match iterations` reports. (Tested on Magento 1.12 and 1.13)

###Community Edition###
Your homepage fails to load the CSS, and a message is displayed saying `There was no 404 CMS page configured or found`. 

I have not spent much time debugging the effects on the community edition, there are likely other symptoms. (Tested on Magento 1.9.1.0)

## Debugging the Issue ##

[Many](http://tutorialmagento.com/fixing-front-controller-reached-100-router-match-iterations) [sources](http://www.magestore.com/magento/magento-front-controller-reached-100-router-match-iterations-error.html) [correctly](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6262129/magento-front-controller-reached-100-router-match-iterations-error) point out that the problem is caused by some of the routers disappearing from the configuration object, meaning there is no router available to match the request.

This error only occurs when the routers configuration was loaded from cache. To stop the bug from bringing down the website and to aid my debugging I rewrote `Mage_Core_Model_Cache::save()` such that it would do some quick data validation, and prevent corrupted data being saved.

```php
    /**
     * Save data
     *
     * @param string $data
     * @param string $id
     * @param array $tags
     * @param int $lifeTime
     * @return bool
     */
    public function save($data, $id, $tags = array(), $lifeTime = null)
    {
        //Start patch for 100 routers problem
        if (strpos($id,'config_global_stores_') !== false) {
            $xml = new SimpleXMLElement($data);
            $xmlPath = $xml->xpath('web/routers/standard');
            if (count($xmlPath) != 1) {
                //Returning true to prevent it from saving an incomplete cache entry
                return true;
            }
        }
        //End patch

        if ($this->_disallowSave) {
            return true;
        }

        /**
         * Add global magento cache tag to all cached data exclude config cache
         */
        if (!in_array(Mage_Core_Model_Config::CACHE_TAG, $tags)) {
            $tags[] = Mage_Core_Model_App::CACHE_TAG;
        }
        return $this->getFrontend()->save((string)$data, $this->_id($id), $this->_tags($tags), $lifeTime);
    }
```

This code change did not 'solve' the issue, but it did stop the website crashing so much. It was also useful as a point of debugging, as I now had a place from which I could monitor and log the issue.

## The Problem ##

By using apache bench to stress my Magento instance along with a lot of `file_put_contents` debugging, I was able to discover that the invalid configuration was generated in the `loadDb` method of `Mage_Core_Model_Config`, but only under the following conditions

1. `Mage_Core_Model_Config::init()` has been called on the singleton twice.
2. The first call to must successfully load from cache and set `$_useCache = true`
3. The second call must fail to retrieve the config from cache, and proceed to rebuild the cache while still having `$_useCache = true`

To understand how we get this flow we'll have to revisit `Mage_Core_Model_Config::init()` and a few other functions.

```php
    /**
     * Initialization of core configuration
     *
     * @return Mage_Core_Model_Config
     */
    public function init($options=array())
    {
        $this->setCacheChecksum(null);
        $this->_cacheLoadedSections = array();
        $this->setOptions($options);
        $this->loadBase();

        $cacheLoad = $this->loadModulesCache();
        if ($cacheLoad) {
            return $this;
        }
        $this->loadModules();
        $this->loadDb();
        $this->saveCache();
        return $this;
    }
    
    /**
     * Load cached modules configuration
     *
     * @return bool
     */
    public function loadModulesCache()
    {
        if (Mage::isInstalled(array('etc_dir' => $this->getOptions()->getEtcDir()))) {
            if ($this->_canUseCacheForInit()) {
                Varien_Profiler::start('mage::app::init::config::load_cache');
                $loaded = $this->loadCache();
                Varien_Profiler::stop('mage::app::init::config::load_cache');
                if ($loaded) {
                    $this->_useCache = true;
                    return true;
                }
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
    
    /**
     * Check if cache can be used for config initialization
     *
     * @return bool
     */
    protected function _canUseCacheForInit()
    {
        return Mage::app()->useCache('config') && $this->_allowCacheForInit
            && !$this->_loadCache($this->_getCacheLockId());
    }
```
