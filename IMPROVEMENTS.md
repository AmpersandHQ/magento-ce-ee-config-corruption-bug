# Config Cache Corruption Fix - 100 Router Match Iterations - Unreadable local.xml

I haven't fully gotten to the bottom of this one yet, but thought I would post my findings as they definitely improve the situation.

I discovered that sometimes the Magento configuration is generated missing a lot of the required nodes. After some brief experimentation, I discovered that the config being saved is consistent with a complete failure of the `Mage_Core_Model_Config:loadDb` method.

A full and valid config is generated by the calling of the following commands:

    $config = Mage::getConfig();
    $config->loadBase();
    $config->loadModules();
    $config->loadDb();
    $config->saveCache();

`loadDb` looks like

    public function loadDb()
    {
        if ($this->_isLocalConfigLoaded && Mage::isInstalled()) {
            Varien_Profiler::start('config/load-db');
            $dbConf = $this->getResourceModel();
            $dbConf->loadToXml($this);
            Varien_Profiler::stop('config/load-db');
        }
        return $this;
    }
    
As you can see, if the `_isLocalConfigLoaded` flag or `Mage::isInstalled()` return false, then no actions will be taken before attempting to save this invalid config in the cache. Ouch.

In my case, it turned out that `Mage::isInstalled()` was erroneously returning `false` despite the `local.xml` being in place. I'm going to continue digging into this further, but for now the following code changes have kept the site alive and stable.

The following basically adds a flag to `Mage_Core_Model_Config` which will prevent a `saveCache` call unless we have actually succeeded to do a `loadDb` call.

    +   protected $allowSaveCache = false;

        public function loadDb()
        {
            if ($this->_isLocalConfigLoaded && Mage::isInstalled()) {
                Varien_Profiler::start('config/load-db');
                $dbConf = $this->getResourceModel();
                $dbConf->loadToXml($this);
                Varien_Profiler::stop('config/load-db');
    +           $this->allowSaveCache = true;
    +       } else {
    +           $this->allowSaveCache = false;
    +       }
            return $this;
        }
        
        public function saveCache($tags=array())
        {
    +       if (!$this->allowSaveCache) {
    +           return $this;
    +       }
    +
    
Ew, that was pretty gross. I know. But this at least prevents bad configuration being cached. The bigger issue here is why my `local.xml` was periodically failing to read. I'll update this when I have answers.

# Config Generation Performance Fix - allowUseCacheForInit

This one is pretty simple. At the very end of `Mage_Core_Model_Config::saveCache` I added the following line.

            unset($this->_cachePartsForSave);
            $this->_removeCache($cacheLockId);
    +       $this->_allowCacheForInit = true;
            return $this;
        }
        
This flag blocks the usage of `_canUseCacheForInit` and by extension, `loadModulesCache`. This flag is set to `false` during the `reinit` method.

This means that, without my change, calls like the following would result in two full regenerations of the configuration cache when it only needed to do one.

    $config = Mage::getConfig();
    $config->reinit()
    $config->init();

This may not be an issue for your site, but we had a cron task running `Mage::app()->init()` within a loop, which was triggering `Mage_Core_Model_Config::init()` to be called in a loop, which caused the configuration to be constantly regenerated multiple times in a loop!

This one line fix settled things down quite a bit.
